# Summary

`JetNet` is a Python package that aims to increase accessibility and reproducibility for machine learning (ML) research in high energy physics (HEP), primarily related to particle jets. Based on the popular PyTorch ML framework, it provides easy-to-access and standardized interfaces for multiple heterogeneous HEP datasets and implementations of evaluation metrics, loss functions, and more general utilities relevant to HEP.

# Statement of need

It is essential in scientific research to maintain standardized benchmark datasets following the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reproducible (FAIR) data principles [@Chen:2021euv], practices for using the data, and methods for evaluating and comparing different algorithms. This can often be difficult in high energy physics (HEP) because of the broad set of formats in which data is released and the expert knowledge required to parse the relevant information. The `JetNet` Python package aims to facilitate this by providing a standard interface and format for HEP datasets, integrated with PyTorch [@NEURIPS2019_9015], to improve accessibility for both HEP experts and new or interdisciplinary researchers looking to do ML. Furthermore, by providing standard formats and implementations for evaluation metrics, results are more easily reproducible, and models are more easily assessed and benchmarked. `JetNet` is complementary to existing efforts for improving HEP dataset accessibility, notably the `EnergyFlow` library [@Komiske:2019jim], with a unique focus to ML applications and integration with PyTorch.

## Content

`JetNet` currently provides easy-to-access and standardized interfaces for the JetNet [@kansal_raghav_2022_6975118], top quark tagging [@kasieczka_gregor_2019_2603256; @Kasieczka:2019dbj], and quark-gluon tagging [@komiske_patrick_2019_3164691] reference datasets, all hosted on Zenodo [@Zenodo]. It also provides standard implementations of generative evaluation metrics [@Kansal:2021cqp; @Kansal:2022spb], including Fréchet physics distance (FPD), kernel physics distance (KPD), 1-Wasserstein distance (W1), Fréchet ParticleNet distance (FPND), coverage, and minimum matching distance (MMD). Finally, `JetNet` implements custom loss functions like a differentiable version of the energy mover's distance [@PhysRevLett.123.041801] and more general jet utilities.

## Impact

The impact of `JetNet` is demonstrated by the surge in ML and HEP research facilitated by the package, including in the areas of generative adversarial networks [@Kansal:2021cqp], transformers [@Kach:2022uzq; @Kansal:2022spb; @Kach:2023rqw], diffusion models [@Leigh:2023toe; @Mikuni:2023dvk], and equivariant networks [@Hao:2022zns; @Buhmann:2023pmh], all accessing datasets, metrics, and more through `JetNet`.

## Future Work

Future work will expand the package to additional dataset loaders, including detector-level data, and different machine learning backends such as JAX [@jax2018github]. Improvements to the performance, such as optional lazy loading of large datasets, are also planned, as well as community challenges to benchmark algorithms facilitated by `JetNet`.
